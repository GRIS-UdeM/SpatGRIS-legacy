SpatGRIS is a multichannel sound spatialization plug-in (up to 8 sources / 16 speakers) available in Audio Unit and VST formats. The free and open-source plug-in allows movement of multichannel sound sources on a variable set of speakers. Modes of grouped movement and a trajectory system are provided for spatialization of stereo and multichannel sources.
