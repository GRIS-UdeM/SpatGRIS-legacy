some notes on osc.
    * ZirkOSC only has a sending connection, to the local ip address 127.0.0.1, port 18032
    * Octogris, for the ipad connection, has a sending connection to the address/port specified in the
    relevant text boxes, and a receiving connection from the "default" local adress (obtained with
    getLocalIPAddress())

WHAT IS NEXT?
* review juce compiler warnings
* version windows
* en mode internal routing, d√©sactiver les components inutiles(dans studio)
* utiliser mode HRTF avec zirkonium
* GUI
    * avoir une texture en background
    * try different fonts

ok. so 2 problems
1- compared to octogris, spatgris surface (free volume) and span (pan span) are reversed.
2- only for source 1, setting volume (or pan) and reading it is reversed

ok. so problem in reaper with number of inputs and outputs. 
before, everything was 8x16. Now, it's 8x16 until preparetoplay, which seems to always be 2x2. check that this is true. 

where is this stuff updated?
filter constructor: using juce max numbers
prepare to play: using gettotal
