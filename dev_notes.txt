some notes on osc.
    * ZirkOSC only has a sending connection, to the local ip address 127.0.0.1, port 18032
    * Octogris, for the ipad connection, has a sending connection to the address/port specified in the
    relevant text boxes, and a receiving connection from the "default" local adress (obtained with
    getLocalIPAddress())
