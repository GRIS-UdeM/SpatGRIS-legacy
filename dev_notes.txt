ok, so need to test presets in current octogris version--DONE

now i need to make this oneSource business work. How to proceed? 
need to have concept of selected source
then mover only moves selected source
and thread moves non-selected sources


in zirkosc
mouseDown/Up and slidersDragStarted/ended call begin/endParameterGesture on selectedsource only
everyone calls processor::move, which
    calls setParameterNotifyingHost for the source passed as argument
        which sets m_iSourceLocationChanged to the source passed as argument
    if independent, we simply set the old values
    if not, call moveCircular(or other)
        which calculates delta between the selected source position (argument) and the old one
        then cycles through all sources
            for selected one, simply set old values
            for unselected, move by delta DIRECTLY (ie not telling host so no automation, not
                setting srcLocation) and set old values

the thread moves sources if
    X-!m_bIsRecordingAutomation
        set whenever an automation begins+ends (mousedown/up, sliderDragStarted/ended
    X-m_iMovementConstraint != Independent
        just get this from processor
    m_iSourceLocationChanged != -1
        set to source number that is changed in setParameters

IN OCTOGRIS
everyone calls mover::begin, which
    calls beginParameterGesture
        X-need to have this only for selected source
    FIGURES OUT ANGLES IF ANGLES ARE FIXED. This needs to be an instantaneous call instead of being
    figured out here and used in move. Well actually, i don't think this is critical.
then everyone calls mover::move, which 
    moves selectedSource
    moves the other sources in circular or delta. THOSE WILL BE THE 2 ONLY MODES ONCE I HAVE MADE
    THE MOVEMENT CONSTRAINT CHANGES INSTANTANEOUS
        NOW HERE. need to figure out how to move unselected sources using the delta of the selected
        source. Some kind of similar mechanism is already in place. 
    then of fucking course, there are the specific symmetric x/y fucking modes which i also need to
    figure out

Ah, i need to NOT record automations when move() is called NOT from kSourceThread

-cliquer sur start trajectore fait des automations from sourceThread, because changing the number of
sources calls it. should only happen once

somthing isn't right. the thread is setting srcLocationChanged. that should really not happen
we got
    thread calls
        mover.begin
        mover.move
            mFilter->setSourceXY01() for selected source (this should not happen, right?)
                this sets the srcLocationChanged for the selected source
            mFilter->setSourceRT for non selected sources
                this sets the srcLocationChanged for all non-selected sources (shouldn't happen,
                right?)
        mover.end

ok, so now i cleaned a bunch of code, and there are no automations written when changing movement
constraints, BUT there is when starting a trajectory
NOW HERE: can record automation on one source, but not read them. I think the problems are that
-thread is not calculating delta properly (probably)
-when writing trajectories we should use the mover (which we do?), somehow sources are not moving
when writing trajectories. ah, it's probably because i force selected source 0, so i need a special
case to have all sources move when kSourceThread


-----------------------------------
-Changing constraint does activate the thread once, with a delta of 0, should not
-clicking trajectory button also activates the thread once
-writing trajectory, thread is activated... is that so also in zirkosc? it should not. the regular
move should set the parameters directly, then the gui should update based on its reading of the
processor
    right, there should be a writingAutomation flag set
    it is not set because the trajectory does not use the mover. this is bad. Ah, that's because
    antoine used my code, which does not have a mover. right. 
in zirk
    thread called once when setting to circular
    and once on mouse up
    once at the end of writing a trajectory
    continuously when reading trajectory/automation
