some notes on osc.
    * ZirkOSC only has a sending connection, to the local ip address 127.0.0.1, port 18032
    * Octogris, for the ipad connection, has a sending connection to the address/port specified in the
    relevant text boxes, and a receiving connection from the "default" local adress (obtained with
    getLocalIPAddress())
--------- 2016-02-10 -----------------
WHAT IS NEXT?
* review juce compiler warnings
* version windows
* en mode internal routing, d√©sactiver les components inutiles(dans studio)
* utiliser mode HRTF avec zirkonium
* GUI
    * avoir une texture en background
    * try different fonts

ok. so 2 problems
1- compared to octogris, spatgris surface (free volume) and span (pan span) are reversed.
2- only for source 1, setting volume (or pan) and reading it is reversed

ok. so problem in reaper with number of inputs and outputs. 

what is critical, is that in processblock, we don't use more inputs/outputs than given by getTotal. 

so currently, getTotal for AU and VST3 is able to read the I/O number of inputs and outputs. NOT vst2.
Check if we can fix this using setPreferredBusArrangement. but if we do that, we need to remove Plugin Channel Configurations from introjucer

ok, there is an example surround plugin which looks at this very problem. With vst2, reaper seems to make a ton of random calls to setPrefferedBusArrangement, so not sure how to deal with that. Could recommend using vst3 with reaper, but need to ensure vst2 is working with DP. 

DP
Spatgris is crashing dp at the moment. Need to test surround. So apparently: 
* dp uses AU by default...
* i cannot load the surround plugin, even though it is in the plugin manager... BECAUSE IT IS A SYNTH. it works really well, and there are several calls to getPreferred, but it ends on createFront7point1. 

LOGIC
seems to also work, but needs to be tested more.

CHECKING OCTOGRIS3
DP: OK
reaper: vst2:OK, vst3: NAN, AU: ok
logic: (probably ok)

ok. so if octogris3 is working... could we not use the same code in SpatGRIS? well wait, vst3 was not working for octogris. but who gives a shit?
so current git version of octogris is the same source code as 3.0.1, but a different version of JUCE, which may be critical. let's try it. 
it doesn't work. so the juce version is probably to blame!

testing juce versions
LATEST PULL: 
* introjucer plygin channel config NOT deprecated
* spatgris 
    * au: load 2x2, 8x8 avail
    * vst3: same
    * vst2: load 2x2, 2x2 max avail


v4.0.1: 
* introjucer plugin channel config deprecated
* octogris vst2 ok, vst3 not
* spatgris: vst2 8x16, vst3 8x8, au 2x2 selected, 8x16 avail
* SO EVERYTHING WORKS. problem is with bleeding edge juce version. need to be careful with this for next JUCE release.

src and speaker positions need to be reset when prepare to play changes their numbers.
