ok, so need to test presets in current octogris version--DONE

now i need to make this oneSource business work. How to proceed? 
need to have concept of selected source
then mover only moves selected source
and thread moves non-selected sources


in zirkosc
mouseDown/Up and slidersDragStarted/ended call begin/endParameterGesture on selectedsource only
everyone calls processor::move, which
    calls setParameterNotifyingHost for the source passed as argument
        which sets m_iSourceLocationChanged to the source passed as argument
    if independent, we simply set the old values
    if not, call moveCircular(or other)
        which calculates delta between the selected source position (argument) and the old one
        then cycles through all sources
            for selected one, simply set old values
            for unselected, move by delta and set old values

the thread moves sources if
    X-!m_bIsRecordingAutomation
        set whenever an automation begins+ends (mousedown/up, sliderDragStarted/ended
    X-m_iMovementConstraint != Independent
        just get this from processor
    m_iSourceLocationChanged != -1
        set to source number that is changed in setParameters

IN OCTOGRIS
everyone calls mover::begin, which
    calls beginParameterGesture
        X-need to have this only for selected source
    FIGURES OUT ANGLES IF ANGLES ARE FIXED. This needs to be an instantaneous call instead of being
    figured out here and used in move. Well actually, i don't think this is critical.
then everyone calls mover::move, which 
    moves selectedSource
    moves the other sources in circular or delta. THOSE WILL BE THE 2 ONLY MODES ONCE I HAVE MADE
    THE MOVEMENT CONSTRAINT CHANGES INSTANTANEOUS
        NOW HERE. need to figure out how to move unselected sources using the delta of the selected
        source. Some kind of similar mechanism is already in place. 
    then of fucking course, there are the specific symmetric x/y fucking modes which i also need to
    figure out
